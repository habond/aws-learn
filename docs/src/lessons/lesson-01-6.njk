        <h3>Step 18: Check CloudFront Metrics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to CloudFront → Your distribution → Monitoring</li>
          <li>Check out:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Requests</strong>: How many people visited</li>
              <li><strong>Bytes downloaded</strong>: How much data served</li>
              <li><strong>Error rate</strong>: Hopefully 0%!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

            <strong>What are Metrics in CloudWatch?</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Metrics are time-series data points that measure something over time - like number of requests per minute, bytes transferred per hour, error percentage. CloudWatch collects metrics from AWS services automatically and lets you graph, monitor, and alert on them.</p>

            <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> "How many people visited my site yesterday?" "Is my site slow right now?" "Did traffic spike after that tweet?" Metrics answer these questions. Without them, you're flying blind - you have no idea if your site is working well or falling apart.</p>

            <p><strong>Key details:</strong> Most AWS services publish basic metrics for free (like CloudFront requests). Metrics have dimensions (filters) - like "all requests" vs "requests for /api/* only". Data is kept for 15 months. You can publish custom metrics from your apps too (costs extra).</p>

            <p><strong>Common gotcha:</strong> Metrics aren't real-time - there's usually 1-5 minute delay. If you refresh your site and check CloudWatch immediately, the data might not be there yet. Also, some metrics require enabling (like detailed S3 metrics) - they're not automatic.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 19: Enable S3 Metrics</h3>
        <pre><code class="language-bash"># Enable request metrics for your bucket
aws s3api put-bucket-metrics-configuration \
  --bucket $BUCKET_NAME \
  --id EntireBucket \
  --metrics-configuration Id=EntireBucket</code></pre>

        <div class="learn-more">
          <div class="learn-more-header">
            <span class="icon">📘</span>
            <strong>What are Request Metrics and why enable them?</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Request metrics are detailed S3 statistics about operations on your bucket - how many GET requests, PUT requests, DELETE requests, how much data transferred, latency per request type. They're optional (cost extra) unlike basic storage metrics (free).</p>

            <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> Basic S3 metrics only show storage size and number of objects. Request metrics show actual usage - are people downloading files? Are there errors? This helps debug problems ("why is my site slow?") and optimize costs ("we're getting charged for 1M requests, where are they coming from?").</p>

            <p><strong>Key details:</strong> Request metrics cost about $0.01 per 1000 metrics requests (cheap for learning, adds up at scale). You can filter to specific prefixes (like /images/*) instead of the entire bucket. Metrics appear in CloudWatch with 1-minute granularity.</p>

            <p><strong>Common gotcha:</strong> Enabling request metrics doesn't retroactively create data - you only get metrics from the time you enable it forward. Also, "EntireBucket" is just an ID we chose - you could name it anything. The ID lets you have multiple metric configurations for different prefixes.</p>

        <h3>Step 20: Create a Dashboard</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to CloudWatch → Dashboards → Create dashboard</li>
          <li>Name it: <code>my-website-dashboard</code></li>
          <li>Add widgets:
            <ul>
              <li>CloudFront requests</li>
              <li>CloudFront bytes downloaded</li>
              <li>S3 bucket size</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Save dashboard</li>
        </ol>

            <strong>What are Dashboards and Widgets?</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="learn-more-content">
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A CloudWatch dashboard is a customizable page that displays multiple metrics in one view. Widgets are the individual visualizations (graphs, numbers, logs) that you add to a dashboard. Think of it like a customizable monitoring homepage for your infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> Instead of clicking through 10 different service pages to check your site's health, you create one dashboard with all key metrics. Open it each morning - if everything looks good, you're done. If something's wrong, the graphs show you immediately.</p>

            <p><strong>Key details:</strong> Widgets can show: line graphs (trends over time), number displays (current value), logs (recent errors), alarms (red/green status). You can have multiple dashboards for different purposes (production, staging, cost monitoring). Dashboards can be shared with your team via links.</p>

            <p><strong>Common gotcha:</strong> Dashboards don't auto-refresh by default - you need to manually refresh or set an auto-refresh interval (1min, 5min, etc). Also, dashboards are region-specific - metrics from us-east-1 won't appear on a dashboard in eu-west-1. Create dashboards in the same region as your resources.</p>
